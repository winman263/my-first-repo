### I live in the city of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, in Australia.

### Reading

Three of my favour books are:

- *Moby Dick* by Herman Melville
- *1984* by George Orwell
- *Catch 22* by Joseph Heller

### Food

Last night I dreamt about eating in restaurants:

1. MacDonalds in Brisbane.
2. Hungry Jacks in Melbourne.
3. Subway in Adelaide.

### Contact

The best way to get in contact with me is by telepathy.
